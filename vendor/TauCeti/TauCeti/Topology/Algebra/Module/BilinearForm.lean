# Nondegeneracy of the bilinear form of a continuous linear map into the dual

A continuous linear map `L : E →L[𝕜] E →L[𝕜] 𝕜` carries a bilinear form
`ContinuousLinearMap.toBilinForm L`, and that form is left-separating exactly when `L` is
injective: both say that no nonzero vector is annihilated by `L`. Reading nondegeneracy of the
form off injectivity of the map is the step that connects the two ways a Hessian is presented —
as a map into the dual space and as a bilinear form — and it has nothing to do with the analysis
that produces the Hessian, so it is recorded here, next to `ContinuousLinearMap.toBilinForm`
itself, rather than with any of its users.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ContinuousLinearMap.separatingLeft_toBilinForm_iff_injective`: the bilinear form of a
  continuous linear map into the dual is left-separating if and only if the map is injective.
* `TauCeti.ContinuousLinearMap.isInvertible_of_injective`: in finite dimensions an injective map
  into the dual is already invertible, the dual having the same dimension as the space.

makes it a linear equivalence onto its range, and the dual has the same finite dimension as the
