# Finite-percept Theorem 12 induction step, without surjectivity

`AISafetyAtlas.Wireheading.GoalPreservation` proves a deterministic
specialization of Everitt, Filan, Daswani and Hutter, AGI 2016, LNCS 9782,
Theorem 12 (extended version `arXiv:1605.03142`, Theorem 16), but
only under `names_surjective`: at every history, *every* world-action and
next-policy pair is emitted by some represented policy.  That premise is
stronger than the source's, which introduces a naming map `ι : P → Π` and says
explicitly that not every policy can have a name.

This module removes it from the one-step induction argument.

## What the source's proof actually uses

Reading the proof of Theorem 12, the comparison is never against an arbitrary
policy.  It is against `π₁`, the agent's own initial policy, which *is* named by
assumption, so the action `(ǎ_t, π₁)` is always available.  The proof then
argues:

* if the selected continuation `π_{t+1}` were worse than `π₁` at some percept,
  it would be no better at any percept and strictly worse at that one;
* percepts are drawn from a finite full-support probability mass function, so a
  pointwise inequality that is strict somewhere makes the *expectation*
  strictly worse;
* hence `(ǎ_t, π_{t+1})` would be strictly worse than the available alternative
  `(ǎ_t, π₁)`, contradicting the optimality of `π_t`.

So the two ingredients are **nameability of the initial policy** and **full
support**, not surjectivity of the naming map.  `Model` records exactly those:
`initial` is a name, `initial_dominates` says `π₁` is optimal in the form the
proof uses, and `prob_sum_one` / `prob_pos` make `prob` a full-support finite
probability mass function.

## Explicit non-claims

* **Finitely many percepts.** Expectations are normalized `Finset` sums over a
  `Fintype`, not integrals. No measure theory is used, so this is the
  finite-percept case of the source's `E_{e_t}`.
* **Not the full source theorem.** `initial_dominates` and `contValue`
  are given; the source derives the corresponding facts from
  modification-independent `ρ` and `u₁` together with the optimal-policy-existence
  result the technical report proves as its Theorem 20 in Appendix A — the
  published chapter prints no proofs, so that is the only place it appears — which
  is not reproduced.  What is reproduced is the induction step of Theorem 12, which
  is where `names_surjective` was previously needed.
* **On-policy only**, as in the source: nothing is claimed off the reached path.
* **Not utility modification**, only policy modification.

/-- **Print's `Π`, the set of all policies.**

Definition 3 reads: *"Let `Π = {(𝒜 × ℰ)* → 𝒜}` be the set of all policies, and
let `ι : 𝒫 → Π` assign names to policies."*  So `Π` is the full function space
from histories to actions, with `𝒜 = 𝒜̌ × 𝒫` — a world action paired with the
name of the next policy.  That is exactly the codomain of `Model.act`, which is
therefore `ι` and not merely an action-selection rule.

Naming `Π` costs nothing and buys the distinction print draws immediately after:
`𝒫` and `Π` are different sets, `ι` need not be onto, and *"some policies will
necessarily lack names"*.  Nothing in this module assumes otherwise. -/

**The index is degenerate at print's Definition 3, which is the model here.**
In a *policy* self-modification model the action selects the next policy and
nothing else — print, introducing the two models: modifications "do not affect
the agent's utility function or belief" — so every member of print's family
`u_t` is `u₁` and every `Q_t` is `qValue`. The family is non-trivial only at
print's Definition 5, the utility self-modification model, which this cluster
does not have.

This is what makes the single-utility rendering print's Definition 12 at print's
own Definition 3, rather than one member of a family the rendering dropped.

**The induction step of Theorem 12, without surjectivity.**

If the current policy acts optimally at a history, the continuation it selects
achieves exactly the initial policy's value at every reachable successor.

The proof never quantifies over unnamed policies.  It compares only against
`(ǎ, initial)`, which is available because `initial` is a name, and uses full
support to turn a single strict percept into a strictly worse expectation.

**Realistic policy modification is safe, on-policy.**

At every reachable successor, the value obtained by the self-modified
continuation equals the value the initial policy would have obtained.  This is
equation (13) of the source at one step, and it holds with no constraint on
which policies have names beyond the initial one having one.
